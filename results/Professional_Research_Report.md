## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Dataset Description
- **Source:** N-BaLoT (Network-based Bot-IoT) Dataset
- **Composition:** 92 CSV files containing real IoT network traffic
- **Sampling Strategy:** 50% random sampling from each file
- **Final Dataset Size:** 3,531,298 samples with 115 features
- **Attack Types:** Gafgyt (combo, junk, scan, tcp, udp) and Mirai (ack, scan, syn, udp, udpplain)

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing
- MinMax normalization applied to all 115 numerical features
- Label encoding: Benign traffic (0), Attack traffic (1)
- Highly imbalanced dataset: 92.1% attacks, 7.9% benign traffic

### 2.3 Model Architectures

#### Statistical-Only Model: Isolation Forest
- **Algorithm:** Unsupervised anomaly detection via random partitioning
- **Configuration:** contamination='auto', random_state=42, n_jobs=-1
- **Training Data:** Benign traffic only
- **Rationale:** Established baseline for comparison with traditional methods

#### LSTM-Only Model: Deep Autoencoder
- **Architecture:** 
  - Input: (1, 115) - reshaped for sequential processing
  - Encoder: LSTM(64, activation='relu')
  - Decoder: RepeatVector(1) → LSTM(115, activation='relu') → TimeDistributed(Dense(115))
- **Training:** 10 epochs, batch size 512, Adam optimizer, MSE loss
- **Anomaly Detection:** Reconstruction error as anomaly score

#### Hybrid Model: Fusion Approach
- **Strategy:** Weighted combination of Statistical and LSTM scores
- **Normalization:** MinMax scaling applied to both score sets
- **Fusion Formula:** `composite_score = (0.6 × LSTM_score) + (0.4 × Statistical_score)`
- **Rationale:** Leverage global outlier detection + sequential pattern recognition
